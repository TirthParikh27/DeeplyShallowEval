With this feature, each additional consecutive year that you and the covered drivers on your policy have not had a claim helps keep your premium lower (up to a maximum NCB discount amount).\n\nWhen you first take out each policy, we calculate the NCB or rating level based on:\n\n- the NCB or rating level you held with your previous insurer; or\n\nwhere you currently do not hold a NCB:\n\n- the claims history of you and any other listed drivers; and\n- the number of years you and any other listed drivers have been driving for,\n\nhowever if you or any other listed drivers have had more than one claim in the past 3 years your NCB will be 0%.\n\nYour NCB discount may vary depending on which State or Territory your vehicle is kept in.\n\nYour policy schedule will show what NCB (if any) has been applied to your policy.\n\nEach year at renewal the NCB for the policy is recalculated. After each subsequent claim free period of insurance, the NCB discount applied to your renewal premium will be increased by one discount level (i.e. 10%) until the maximum available NCB discount is reached. Your NCB or rating level may be reduced at renewal if a claim is made as outlined below.\n\nPremiums are calculated prior to any no claim bonus discount being applied, see the \"your premium\" section for further information.

This guarantee is not transferable.\n\n Unrepaired damage\n\nIf your vehicle had any unrepaired damage before an incident, then you may need to contribute to the repair costs.\n\nYou need to do this when the damage caused by the incident results in us having to repair more areas of your vehicle than were affected by the unrepaired damage. Before we ask you to contribute we will explain why, tell you how much it will be and how to pay it prior to the authorisation of any repairs.\n\n Undamaged areas\n\nWe will not repair undamaged areas of your vehicle that have not been affected by damage caused by the incident to ensure a uniform appearance.
