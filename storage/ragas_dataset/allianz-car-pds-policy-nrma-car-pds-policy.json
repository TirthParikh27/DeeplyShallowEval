      "Your No Claim Bonus (NCB) or Rating Level\n\nA no claims bonus (NCB) or rating level is only applicable when you take out Comprehensive insurance.\n\nA no claims bonus or a rating level mean the same thing.\n\nYour no claims bonus or rating level rewards you for not having made claims. With this feature, each additional consecutive year that you and the covered drivers on your policy have not had a claim helps keep your premium lower (up to a maximum NCB discount amount).\n\nWhen you first take out each policy, we calculate the NCB or rating level based on:\n\n- the NCB or rating level you held with your previous insurer; or\n\nwhere you currently do not hold a NCB:\n\n- the claims history of you and any other listed drivers; and\n- the number of years you and any other listed drivers have been driving for,\n\nhowever if you or any other listed drivers have had more than one claim in the past 3 years your NCB will be 0%.\n\nYour NCB discount may vary depending on which State or Territory your vehicle is kept in.\n\nYour policy schedule will show what NCB (if any) has been applied to your policy.\n\nEach year at renewal the NCB for the policy is recalculated. After each subsequent claim free period of insurance, the NCB discount applied to your renewal premium will be increased by one discount level (i.e. 10%) until the maximum available NCB discount is reached. Your NCB or rating level may be reduced at renewal if a claim is made as outlined below.\n\nPremiums are calculated prior to any no claim bonus discount being applied, see the \"your premium\" section for further information. A no claims bonus discount only applies to your base premium (excluding any policy options, government taxes, charges or levies that may apply).\n\nThe premium for a policy may increase as a result of a claim or due to other factors we determine in setting our premiums, regardless of whether the no claim bonus discount amount is altered.\n\n What happens to my NCB or rating level at renewal if I make a claim?\n\nIn the event that you make a claim:\n\n- that is an at-fault claim; or\n- that is a not at-fault claim where:\n  - you are unable to provide us with the responsible party\u2019s name, address and vehicle registration number or any other information that would reasonably allow us to identify the person so that we can exercise our rights of recovery; or\n  - it is made due to any storm, naturally occurring event or a collision with an animal; or"

    "1": "The maximum payout for a vehicle insurance claim is determined by the agreed value of your vehicle shown on your current Certificate of Insurance or your vehicle's market value, depending on the type of insurance chosen.",
    "2": "An NRMA Partner Repairer is involved in the repair process of your vehicle as part of the insurance coverage. They are listed under the benefits of Third Party Property Damage Insurance, indicating that they play a role in repairing your vehicle when you make a claim.",
    "3": "The Third Party Property Damage Insurance policy provides liability cover, and the basic excess amount is what you pay if you make a claim.",
    "4": "The key benefits included in a Third Party Fire & Theft Insurance policy are coverage for loss or damage to your vehicle, access to any NRMA Partner Repairer, coverage for crashes with an at-fault driver, emergency repairs, emergency transport and accommodation, and a hire car after theft or attempted theft.",
    "5": "The context mentions a section titled 'Businesses registered for GST' under the claims and what we pay category, indicating that there are specific considerations for businesses registered for GST when making insurance claims.",
    "6": "Your NCB discount may vary depending on which State or Territory your vehicle is kept in.",
    "7": "The conditions and exclusions in your insurance coverage significantly impact the claims process, especially concerning hire car arrangements and recovery actions. According to the policy, you must not arrange your own hire car without prior written consent from the insurer, as doing so may result in the insurer deciding not to pay for the hire car. Additionally, the policy outlines that certain costs related to the hire car, such as running costs and additional hire car costs, are not covered. In terms of recovery actions, the insurer may exercise all rights you have in connection with the loss or damage suffered. You must provide all necessary information and cooperation for the insurer to pursue recovery actions, and you must not assign your rights or opt-out of proceedings without written consent. Furthermore, the policy excludes coverage for certain types of loss or damage, such as tyre damage from road cuts or mechanical failures, and does not cover consequential losses like loss of use or enjoyment of the vehicle. These exclusions and conditions must be carefully considered when navigating the claims process.",
    "8": "To replace your vehicle with a new one under your insurance policy, the following conditions must be met: you must have bought your vehicle as a new or demonstrator vehicle, the incident covered by the policy must occur within 2 years from when your vehicle was first registered, and your vehicle's tare weight must be less than 2.5 tonnes. Additionally, to ensure your insurance policy remains valid, you have responsibilities such as informing the insurer about changes that affect your vehicle, including changes in the address where you normally keep your vehicle, changes in the way you use your vehicle, and if you use your vehicle for activities like driver education courses or charity events. Failure to meet these responsibilities may result in the insurer refusing to pay your claim or reducing the claim amount, and potentially canceling your policy.",
    "9": "For claim acceptance when your car is not drivable, the insurance conditions state that the insurer will arrange a hire car for you, and you must not arrange your own hire car unless you obtain prior written consent. Your vehicle must be not drivable, unsafe to drive, or in for repairs. In the case of staying mobile after a not at fault collision, if the claim is accepted and the fault was caused by another person, the insurer will provide a rental or loan car or a daily travel allowance of $50. The rental or loan car benefit is provided from the date repairs are authorized or the vehicle is made available for repairs, whichever is later, for a maximum of 30 days or until the claim is settled. The insurer will not pay for the cost of fuel or any accidental loss or damage to the rental or loan car.",
    "10": "The insurance policy covers emergency repairs up to $800 to make your vehicle secure or get you back on the road safely, provided you pay upfront and submit a tax invoice. These repairs must be directly related to the incident claimed. The market value of a vehicle is determined by the cost to replace it with a similar make, model, age, and condition vehicle, excluding costs like registration and insurance. Factors considered include local market prices, the vehicle's condition, and any modifications or accessories listed on the policy schedule.",
    "11": "To manage out-of-pocket expenses, you should seek agreement from the insurance provider before incurring any costs to ensure they can be claimed back on your policy. If you do not obtain agreement first, only reasonable costs will be paid. Regarding the excess payment process, a claim is only accepted if the total amount is more than any applicable excesses. If an excess applies, it may be deducted from the claim payment, or you may be required to pay it to the insurer, repairer, or supplier. You can also choose a higher basic excess to reduce your premium if you have Comprehensive Plus or Comprehensive Insurance.",
    "12": "If your car had unrepaired hail damage before the crash, you may need to contribute to the repair costs if the unrepaired damage results in more areas needing repair than were affected by the incident. For example, if the bonnet was partly damaged in the crash but also had unrepaired hail damage, the whole bonnet might need replacement, and you would need to agree to contribute to the cost. Regarding the parts used, if your vehicle is under 3 years old, genuine new parts will be used when reasonably available. If it is 3 years or older, either genuine new parts or quality non-mechanical reusable parts may be used, depending on availability and other conditions. However, if the driver was under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the incident, your policy does not cover the incident. If you were not the driver, you might still be covered for loss or damage if you can prove you had no reason to suspect the driver was under the influence, but liability cover for the driver would not be provided.",
    "13": "The insurance policy specifies that if a claim is made solely for the cost of repairing or replacing the windscreen, sunroof, or window glass due to accidental damage, the no claim bonus entitlement will not be impacted. This means that such claims do not affect the policyholder's no claim bonus. However, if the vehicle is driven by an unnamed driver, an Unnamed driver excess of $2,500 will be applied, replacing all other excesses applicable to the policy. This excess is applicable when the policy schedule indicates that the 'Named driver option' applies and the incident occurred with a driver not listed as a named driver.",
    "14": "The exclusion scenarios for Third Party Fire & Theft Insurance are outlined in a table that specifies different types of insurance coverage exclusions. If a vehicle is recovered after a theft claim has been paid under Third Party Fire & Theft Insurance, the recovered vehicle becomes the property of the insurance company. However, at the company's discretion and if it is safe to do so, the policyholder may reclaim the recovered vehicle by agreeing to pay the salvage price. Additionally, if a claim is settled under the 'Uninsured motorist extension,' the insurance company will pay the market value up to $5,000, less the estimated salvage value and any unpaid premium, allowing the policyholder to keep the vehicle.",
    "15": "Third Party Fire & Theft Insurance offers specific cover options and benefits distinct from other insurance types such as Comprehensive Plus Insurance, Comprehensive Insurance, and Third Party Property Damage Insurance. However, it also comes with its own set of exclusion scenarios. The benefits of Third Party Fire & Theft Insurance are outlined in the insurance cover options and benefits summary, while the exclusion scenarios are detailed in a separate table. This table highlights the exclusions specific to Third Party Fire & Theft Insurance, allowing policyholders to understand how these exclusions compare to those of Comprehensive and Third Party Property Damage Insurance.",
    "16": "The basic excess amount for the Third Party Property Damage Insurance policy is specified in the table titled 'Third Party Property Damage Insurance Policy Details'. Similarly, the basic excess amount for the Comprehensive Plus Insurance policy is detailed in the table titled 'Comprehensive Plus Insurance Policy Details'.",
    "17": "Under Third Party Fire & Theft Insurance, the maximum payout for a vehicle is the market value up to $10,000. Additional benefits include coverage for a crash with an at-fault driver, emergency repairs, emergency transport and accommodation, and a hire car after theft or attempted theft.",
    "18": "The PDS affects the assessment and settlement of your insurance claim by outlining specific limits, exclusions, and conditions that are considered during the claim assessment process. It also specifies that you should seek agreement before incurring any out-of-pocket expenses to ensure they can be claimed back. If agreement is not obtained first, only reasonable costs will be paid. Additionally, during settlement, any applicable excesses, unpaid premiums, unused registration, CTP insurance premium, and salvage value of your vehicle may be deducted.",
    "19": "If you have Third Party Fire & Theft Insurance, the most that is paid is your vehicle\u2019s market value up to $10,000. Additionally, if you make a claim under 'Crash with at fault driver', the most paid is the market value of your vehicle up to $5,000.",
    "20": "If you have Third Party Fire & Theft insurance and need your car repaired, you can choose your own repairer to fix your vehicle. Your choice of repairer must have all the necessary equipment, skills, capabilities, licences, and authorisations required by law to complete the repairs. Once you\u2019ve chosen a repairer, the insurance company will decide whether to authorise and pay for the reasonable cost to repair your vehicle or pay you the reasonable cost to repair your vehicle as determined by them. They may consider several factors, including quotes from NRMA Partner Repairers, their nominated repair methods for the type of damage to your vehicle, and reports from their assessors."
